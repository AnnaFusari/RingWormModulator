    RingWorm Modulator is a basic emulation of the iconic Ring Worm Modulator pedal from Way Huge. It is designed for mono audio signal and it provides a wide range of creativities possibilities thanks to the amplitude modulation made by the oscillator, and the different LFO waveforms.

## Key features

<ul>
  <li>Ring modulation: the heart of the plugin is ring modulation, a technique that produces unique, harmonically rich sounds by multiplying the input signal with a sine oscillator used as the carrier wave </li>
  <li>LFO waveforms: the carrier wave is modulated in frequency by an LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) that offers a diverse range of waveforms controlled by the MODE parameter
      <ul>
          <li>Sine</li>
          <li>Squared</li>
          <li>Step squared</li>
          <li>Random: it provides a waveform composed by random values</li>
          <li>Envelope folllower: the nevelope of the input signal is used as an LFO waveform</li>
      </ul>
